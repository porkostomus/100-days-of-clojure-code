# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Just Juxt #34: Read Roman numerals (4clojure #91)

**Thoughts:** Fun fact: [Subtractive notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_notation) was not the original pattern for Roman numerals. I wonder how much this change had to do with making clock faces appear more balanced.

Today was very exciting for me because yesterday's challenge was completed... by a fellow participant! I received a [pull request](https://github.com/porkostomus/ctrain/commit/5fadbea52f3da219fbfd81fe70d92b1b6501439c) from [kazesberger](https://github.com/kazesberger) addressing the issue that I spoke of yesterday.

Speaking of PRs, I also got some help on [Cryogen Now!](https://gitlab.com/cryogenweb/cryogenweb.gitlab.io), a forkable template I made so that people can get a Clojure static site running on Gitlab Pages in just a few clicks. It took me way too long to get the configuration right, and don't want anyone to ever have to go through that. Github has [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) which uses Ruby, and now we've got one too!

### Day 2: September 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Published Just Juxt #33: Graph Connectivity (4clojure #91)

**Thoughts:** I wrote a [blog post](https://porkostomus.gitlab.io/posts-output/2018-09-16-day-2/) about my ctrain app that I started awhile back and got stuck. I did this in the spirit of public struggling - I spend so much time looking at other people's solutions that I end up spending proportionally less on figuring them out myself - and found myself trying to do it again with this challenge. So I wanted to do something that I knew I didn't know how to solve. Sure, it feels like a bit of a copout using something that I started 9 months ago, but hey, there are still 98 more days left of this challenge! I could spend a day revisiting each one of my projects, and still have most of the days left for trying new things. I feel like it's utilizing the challenge for a good purpose.

Though I couldn't figure out how to fix a certain bug, the program I made does work! In fact, I made [several Clojure tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdB5dhPXiXc&list=PLU4xPIn8mcE69QF41HoFaHxw2Whk3h7PQ) with it.

### Day 1: September 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Published Just Juxt #32: Cartesian Product (4clojure #90)

**Thoughts:** I decided to merge my existing project into the challenge, since I've been doing the 4clojure problems for the past month for Just Juxt. However, in the spirit of 100 Days Of Code, I will be extending the amount of time I spend on them. The format I've been using is a Cryogen blog with KLIPSE snippets, which I find to be very effective for both working on the exercises as well as presenting them. Each article includes a cljs.test framework for the problem, and having the code actually running in the browser is the best way to know that it works!

I also enjoy producing Clojure tutorials and stuff on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/bobbytowers), so if something seems particularly inspiring during the challenge, I'll post a video on it!
