# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Published Just Juxt #32: Cartesian Product (4clojure #90)

**Thoughts:** I decided to merge my existing project into the challenge, since I've been doing the 4clojure problems for the past month for Just Juxt. However, in the spirit of 100 Days Of Code, I will be extending the amount of time I spend on them.
