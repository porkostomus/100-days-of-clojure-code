# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Published Just Juxt #32: Cartesian Product (4clojure #90)

**Thoughts:** I decided to merge my existing project into the challenge, since I've been doing the 4clojure problems for the past month for Just Juxt. However, in the spirit of 100 Days Of Code, I will be extending the amount of time I spend on them. The format I've been using is a Cryogen blog with KLIPSE snippets, which I find to be very effective for both working on the exercises as well as presenting them. Each article includes a cljs.test framework for the problem, and having the code actually running in the browser is the best way to know that it works!

I also enjoy producing Clojure tutorials and stuff on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/bobbytowers), so if something seems particularly inspiring during the challenge, I'll post a video on it!

### Day 2: September 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Published Just Juxt #33: Graph Connectivity (4clojure #91)

**Thoughts:** I wrote a [blog post](https://porkostomus.gitlab.io/posts-output/2018-09-16-day-2/) about my ctrain app that I started awhile back and got stuck. I did this in the spirit of public struggling - I spend so much time looking at other people's solutions that I end up spending proportionally less on figuring them out myself - and found myself trying to do it again with this challenge. So I wanted to do something that I knew I didn't know how to solve. Sure, it feels like a bit of a copout using something that I started 9 months ago, but hey, there are still 98 more days left of this challenge! I could spend a day revisiting each one of my projects, and still have most of the days left for trying new things. I feel like it's utilizing the challenge for a good purpose.

Though I couldn't figure out how to fix a certain bug, the program I made does work! In fact, I made [several Clojure tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdB5dhPXiXc&list=PLU4xPIn8mcE69QF41HoFaHxw2Whk3h7PQ) with it.
