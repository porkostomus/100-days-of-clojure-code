# 100 Days of Clojure Code<a id="sec-1"></a>

## Day 19<a id="sec-1-1"></a>

Yo, I'm in org mode. Today I'm doing stuff:

### Codecademy stuff on UI design.<a id="sec-1-1-1"></a>

Did the HTML course just for the sake of completeness, and actually learned stuff.

### Setting up spacemacs<a id="sec-1-1-2"></a>

One reason I love Clojure is because I only have one hand, and with Clojure you only need one! Seriously&#x2026; I doubt that any other language encourages such brevity - one of Rich's reasons for choosing "nil" over "null" was "It's a little bit shorter"! But with Clojure and Vim or Spacemacs Evil Mode, you only need one finger!

Got the cyberpunk theme with the nyan cat and fancy symbols!

### Moved this journal into org mode<a id="sec-1-1-3"></a>

Yes, here we are. Isn't it beautiful?

Then, we can export to markdown. In fact, we can enable GitHub support in the config.

We're gonna need to follow [this](http://spacemacs.org/layers/+emacs/org/README.html). (see that? that's a link, dawg)

## Day 20<a id="sec-1-2"></a>

### Successfully checked my gmail in spacemacs with mu4e and offlineimap<a id="sec-1-2-1"></a>

This could be an entire article of its own. In fact, I wrote a tutorial on this last year, but it already broke from something changing. It felt like a bit of a "right of passage" into emacs geekdom, kinda like installing Gentoo for Linux.

But here's the way I see it:

1.  Clojurians love emacs

    It's still the most popular Clojure editor, right?

2.  Those who love emacs, love to do lots of stuff in emacs

    Like check our email. As much satisfaction as I'd likely get from making this into a blog post, it ought to be enough that the file .offlineimaprc is in my [spacemacs-config](https://github.com/porkostomus/spacemacs-config) repo. I'll just add the instructions in the README to install offlineimap and mu4e.

### Having a fight with my browser tabs.<a id="sec-1-2-2"></a>

That is, having too many open. Feels like a sign that I'm trying to do too many things at once, I'm trying to close tabs to get back to a reasonable number of tasks but everything seems important. so&#x2026; org-mode to the rescue! Let's break down the things I'm actively doing.

1.  Codecademy - Web design courses

    I used codecademy when I first started getting back into web stuff a few years ago. Then, I read [4 Reasons Why You Shouldnâ€™t Learn to Code With Codeacademy,](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-reasons-shouldnt-learn-code-codeacademy/) which explains that doing that stuff will teach you the syntax, but not how to solve problems. That didn't make me stop using the site, but then I felt a little silly about it because I knew that the author was right. The big win though from reading it was finding out about Project Euler, which turned out to be a great help when I was first learning Clojure.
    
    Now, however, I'm returning to them in order to combat another one of my fears: Holes in my knowledge. I can never be ashamed to go back to the beginning. I have a fear of becoming "one of those people" (in my imagination?) whom I perceive as lacking a solid foundation due to insufficient time in the woodshed.
    
    I refuse to develop for the web without properly understanding the basic web infrastructure.
    
    So that's how I'm justifying spending time doing the basic codecademy courses again. So that's a browser tab. And another one for a [pro-level course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-navigation-design) that I want to take while I've got a free week. But not only that&#x2026;

2.  Set up a live HTML/CSS [playground site](https://porkostomus.gitlab.io/plain-html/) on GitLab

    For just testing the codecademy practice sites! I ought to do one on GitHub as well, just to keep everything familiar.
    
    That's 2 tabs, for the source code and the site itself.

3.  CirclCI

    Just seems like it is important. So that's a browser tab.

4.  jr0cket's spacemacs book

    This one is a very high priority. I should probably move this one up to indicate that. But I need to learn org-mode&#x2026;

5.  Clojurians Slack

    Always gotta have this open! Don't know what I'd do without the constant Clojure chatter!
    
    That's actually all. I managed to close several while writing this (like twitter), so it proved a valuable exercise.

### Now I need to look up the key binding in order to publish this!<a id="sec-1-2-3"></a>

I think it was a regular emacs binding like C-c C-e m or something&#x2026;

Holy crap, I was right.
