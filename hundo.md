# 100 Days of Clojure Code<a id="sec-1"></a>

## Day 19<a id="sec-1-1"></a>

Yo, I'm in org mode. Today I'm doing stuff:

### Codecademy stuff on UI design.<a id="sec-1-1-1"></a>

Did the HTML course just for the sake of completeness, and actually learned stuff.

### Setting up spacemacs<a id="sec-1-1-2"></a>

One reason I love Clojure is because I only have one hand, and with Clojure you only need one! Seriously&#x2026; I doubt that any other language encourages such brevity - one of Rich's reasons for choosing "nil" over "null" was "It's a little bit shorter"! But with Clojure and Vim or Spacemacs Evil Mode, you only need one finger!

Got the cyberpunk theme with the nyan cat and fancy symbols!

### Moved this journal into org mode<a id="sec-1-1-3"></a>

Yes, here we are. Isn't it beautiful?

Then, we can export to markdown. In fact, we can enable GitHub support in the config.

We're gonna need to follow [this](http://spacemacs.org/layers/+emacs/org/README.html). (see that? that's a link, dawg)
